## Description

This Python program demonstrates four basic arithmetic operations, each producing the result of 8:

1. **Addition (5+3)**: Adds 5 and 3 to get 8
2. **Subtraction (15-7)**: Subtracts 7 from 15 to get 8
3. **Multiplication (2*4)**: Multiplies 2 by 4 to get 8
4. **Division (16/2)**: Divides 16 by 2 to get 8.0 (note: division in Python 3 returns a float)

Each operation is preceded by a comment explaining what calculation is being performed.
